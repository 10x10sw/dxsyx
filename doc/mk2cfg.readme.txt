The mk2config file is used to generate or modify DX7 mk2 (DX7s/DX7IID/DX7IIFD)
additional voice parameters.
For information about what each of these parameters means, and for the valid
range of each value, please see the file dx7mk2-additional-sysex.txt in this
project, or the DX7s ownerâ€™s manual. One copy can be found at:
https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/mth192/pages/dx7/manuals/dx7s-man.pdf

Note: Although the amplitude modulation sensitivity for each oscillator
(operator) is part of the additional parameters structure, it is normally copied
(and optionally doubled) from the base DX7 voice data by the dxsyx program. If
you want to override that behavior by supplying values here, however, you can do
so.

The mk2config file must have exactly 32 lines. Each line may have one or more of
the following values. Any unspecified values will be left at zero (except for
op?_amp_mod which is copied from the base voice):

osc1_scale=0 osc2_scale=0 osc3_scale=0 osc4_scale=0 osc5_scale=0 osc6_scale=0 osc1_amp_mod=0 osc2_amp_mod=0 osc3_amp_mod=0 osc4_amp_mod=0 osc5_amp_mod=0 osc6_amp_mod=0 rnd_pitch=0 peg_vel_sw=0 lfo_key_trig=0 peg_range=0 pb_range=0 key_mode=0 pb_mode=0 pb_step=0 port_step=0 port_mode=0 port_time=0 mw_pmod=0 mw_amod=0 mw_eg_bias=0 fc1_pmod=0 fc1_amod=0 fc1_eg_bias=0 fc1_volume=0 bc_pmod=0 bc_amod=0 bc_eg_bias=0 bc_pitch_bias=0 at_pmod=0 at_amod=0 at_eg_bias=0 at_pitch_bias=0 peg_rate_scale=0 fc2_pmod=0 fc2_amod=0 fc2_eg_bias=0 fc2_volume=0 midi_ctrl_pmod=0 midi_ctrl_amod=0 midi_ctrl_eg_bias=0 midi_ctrl_volume=0 fc1_as_cs1=0 unison_detune=0
